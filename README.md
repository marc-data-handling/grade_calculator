# Introduction - Grade Calculator
We aimed to develop a grade calculator that helps to examine one's grades and generates valuable
insights. It calculates the grade point average, not only overall, but also by semester or by
compulsory courses. In addition, it can generate graphs that either reflect the progress of one's
studies or show one's own grade distribution. The grade calculator can also search for the best and
worst grades, return the courses as data frames and save them as csv files. In addition to saving as
csv files it is also possible to load data frames.

The implementation of our project falls back on the concept of object-oriented programming and
two self-written classes. These classes, "Student" and "Subject" form the core of our program. We
import the corresponding Python files into our interface for the terminal
(user_interface_terminal.py), which allows one to make use of our classes, without knowing Python
syntax. Additionally, the file “example” is a jupyter notebook and is meant to show the usage of our
classes. It demonstrates how our classes work and provides demonstrations of the functionality of
the different methods.

Finally, we tried to build a web application with the Python library ‘Flask’, which anyone can use. In
doing so, we got to know the HTML syntax better, as this library relies on HTML files to run a web
application. The file "app.py" contains the code and the corresponding HTML files can be found in
the templates folder.
